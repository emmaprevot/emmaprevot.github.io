I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can change lives, and nowhere is this more impactful than in healthcare. I believe Artificial Intelligence has the power to revolutionize how we understand and treat diseases, and I’m passionate about being part of that change. What excites me most is how fast this field evolves—there’s always something new to learn, and I love the challenge of staying ahead and pushing boundaries.

My background is a mix of Physics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Statistics, and over time, I’ve developed a deep interest in how these disciplines come together to tackle real-world problems. After graduating with First Class Honours in Physics with Medical Physics from UCL in 2022, I completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at Cambridge in 2023. I am now a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, where I focus on predictive and generative statistical machine learning to advance healthcare applications, specifically multiple sclerosis. My work is funded by the EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training in Health Data Science, and I am supervised by Professor Chris Holmes, Professor Thomas Nichols, Dr Habib Ganjgahi.

I don’t just aim to excel academically—I genuinely enjoy contributing to the communities I’m part of. Whether it’s mentoring, collaborating, or diving into new challenges, I approach everything with curiosity and enthusiasm. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and step outside my comfort zone because that’s where the most exciting opportunities happen.
