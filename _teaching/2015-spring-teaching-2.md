This module introduces advanced statistical methods, including smoothing techniques like local polynomials and nonparametric inference with bandwidth selection and cross-validation. Topics also cover multivariate smoothers, Generalised Additive Models (GAMs), and inference using simulation-based methods such as Monte Carlo and permutation tests, rank statistics, and bootstrapping. Additionally, the course delves into Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), exploring their specification and key algorithms like the forward-backward algorithm and the Kalman filter. I tutored the Practical sessions.
